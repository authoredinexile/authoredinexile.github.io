Invisible to the human eye, they devour flesh, fleed on pair and sorrow, or steal your innocence. Though humanity has powerful foes, they have even more powerful allies, the secret race of jinn known as the <q>Guardans</q>, whose sole purpose is to protect the human race from Harvester interference.
In this story, a young boy is pulled into the world of Guardians and Harvesters by the enigmatic <q>Prince of Assassins</q>. Mysteries unfold as the boy learns of this new world that threatens to swallow him whole."
